# NASSCOM-VSD_VLSI_SOC_DESIGN
This repo walks through the concepts discussed and learnt in 5 days workshop by VLSI SYSTEM DESIGN organisation .
## DAY-1
### SK1- Lecture1

#### 1. Locating the Microcontroller
This image showcases an Arduino board with the microcontroller circled. This chip is the central processing unit responsible for executing your code and controlling the board's functionalities.


#### 2. Microcontroller Internal Structure
This diagram illustrates the internal architecture of a typical microcontroller. Key components include:
Processor/SoC (System on a Chip): The "brain" of the microcontroller responsible for executing instructions.
SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory): Volatile memory used for temporary data storage while the microcontroller is running.
Direct I2C, SPI, GPIO, PWM: These are communication protocols and input/output pins that allow the microcontroller to interact with external sensors, actuators, and other devices.


#### 3. Zooming into the Microcontroller Die
This image provides a magnified view of the silicon die inside the microcontroller. Notable features:
RISC-V SoC: Indicates that the microcontroller utilizes the RISC-V instruction set architecture, known for its efficiency and open-source nature.
GPIO bank: A group of General Purpose Input/Output pins that can be configured as either inputs or outputs for interfacing with external components.
SRAM: Static RAM, a type of memory that retains its contents even when power is off, often used for storing critical program data.
Foundry IP's: Intellectual Property blocks licensed from semiconductor foundries, representing pre-designed and verified circuit modules integrated into the microcontroller.
Macros: Refers to larger functional blocks within the microcontroller's design, encompassing multiple logic gates and components.
