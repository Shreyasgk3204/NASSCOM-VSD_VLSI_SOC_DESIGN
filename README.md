# NASSCOM-VSD_VLSI_SOC_DESIGN
This repo walks through the concepts discussed and learnt in 5 days workshop by VLSI SYSTEM DESIGN organisation .
## DAY-1
### SK1- Lecture1

#### 1. Locating the Microcontroller
This image showcases an Arduino board with the microcontroller circled. This chip is the central processing unit responsible for executing your code and controlling the board's functionalities.
#### 2. Microcontroller Internal Structure
This diagram illustrates the internal architecture of a typical microcontroller. Key components include:
Processor/SoC (System on a Chip): The "brain" of the microcontroller responsible for executing instructions.
SDRAM (Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory): Volatile memory used for temporary data storage while the microcontroller is running.
Direct I2C, SPI, GPIO, PWM: These are communication protocols and input/output pins that allow the microcontroller to interact with external sensors, actuators, and other devices.
